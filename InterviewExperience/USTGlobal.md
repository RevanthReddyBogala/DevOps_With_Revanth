### Feedback from the Interviewer: 

- You are good but you should be strong enough with the answers.

Verdict : success and after 2 days said client is not shortlisted


My questions :

<details><summary> can you please write any one of the script that you write in your organization </summary><br>
example of a shell script I wrote for automating the deployment process using Jenkins. This script is used to build a Docker image, push it to a Docker registry, and then deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster.

#### Shell-Script for CI/CD Automation

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status
set -e  #This ensures the script exits immediately if any command fails.

# Variables - These variables store the necessary information like the Docker image name, tag, registry, Kubernetes namespace, deployment name, and paths.
DOCKER_IMAGE="myapp"
DOCKER_TAG="latest"
DOCKER_REGISTRY="docker.io/myusername"
KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE="myapp-namespace"
DEPLOYMENT_NAME="myapp-deployment"
DOCKERFILE_PATH="."
KUBERNETES_MANIFEST="k8s-deployment.yaml"

# Build Docker image 
echo "Building Docker image..."
docker build -t ${DOCKER_REGISTRY}/${DOCKER_IMAGE}:${DOCKER_TAG} ${DOCKERFILE_PATH} # This command builds the Docker image using the specified Dockerfile path

# Push Docker image to registry
echo "Pushing Docker image to registry..."
docker push ${DOCKER_REGISTRY}/${DOCKER_IMAGE}:${DOCKER_TAG} #This command pushes the built Docker image to the specified Docker registry.


# Update Kubernetes deployment
echo "Updating Kubernetes deployment..."
kubectl set image deployment/${DEPLOYMENT_NAME} ${DOCKER_IMAGE}=${DOCKER_REGISTRY}/${DOCKER_IMAGE}:${DOCKER_TAG} -n ${KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE} #This command updates the Kubernetes deployment to use the new Docker image

# Check deployment status
echo "Checking deployment status..."
kubectl rollout status deployment/${DEPLOYMENT_NAME} -n ${KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE} #This command checks the status of the Kubernetes deployment rollout

echo "Deployment completed successfully."

# Optional: Apply Kubernetes manifest (if changes are required)
# echo "Applying Kubernetes manifest..."
# kubectl apply -f ${KUBERNETES_MANIFEST} -n ${KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE}

echo "Script execution finished." #This prints a message indicating that the script execution is finished.

```

<details><summary>can you please write any one of the script that you write in your organization in python ?</summary> Here's a Python script that automates the process of checking the status of a Jenkins job, triggering a new build, and monitoring the build progress. This script uses the Jenkins REST API and the requests library in Python

### Python script for jenkins Automation
```python
import requests
import time
import sys

# Jenkins server details 
JENKINS_URL = 'http://jenkins.example.com'
JOB_NAME = 'my-jenkins-job'
JENKINS_USER = 'your_username'
JENKINS_TOKEN = 'your_api_token'

# Function to get the status of the last build
def get_last_build_status():
    url = f"{JENKINS_URL}/job/{JOB_NAME}/lastBuild/api/json"
    response = requests.get(url, auth=(JENKINS_USER, JENKINS_TOKEN))
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        print(f"Failed to get last build status: {response.status_code}")
        sys.exit(1)

# Function to trigger a new build
def trigger_build():
    url = f"{JENKINS_URL}/job/{JOB_NAME}/build"
    response = requests.post(url, auth=(JENKINS_USER, JENKINS_TOKEN))
    
    if response.status_code == 201:
        print("Build triggered successfully.")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to trigger build: {response.status_code}")
        sys.exit(1)

# Function to monitor the build status
def monitor_build():
    while True:
        last_build = get_last_build_status()
        building = last_build.get('building')
        build_number = last_build.get('number')
        result = last_build.get('result')

        if building:
            print(f"Build {build_number} is in progress...")
            time.sleep(10)
        else:
            print(f"Build {build_number} completed with status: {result}")
            if result == 'SUCCESS':
                print("Build completed successfully.")
            else:
                print("Build failed.")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    last_build = get_last_build_status()
    last_build_number = last_build.get('number')
    
    print(f"Last build number: {last_build_number}")
    print(f"Last build status: {last_build.get('result')}")

    user_input = input("Do you want to trigger a new build? (yes/no): ").strip().lower()

    if user_input == 'yes':
        trigger_build()
        monitor_build()
    else:
        print("Build not triggered.")

```
