GitHub Actions workflows can run external scripts on their runners
The on code block specifies that this workflow should run on the following events:

workflow_dispatch: when manually triggered from the Actions UI
push.branches.main: when a commit gets pushed to the mainbranch
pull_request: when any event related to a pull request occurs
The permissions code block specifies that the workflow has file reading permissions. The concurrency code block specifies the concurrency group and uses cancel-in-progress to terminate any other workflows or jobs using the concurrency group.

The check-links job runs in seven steps:

1. Check out the repository code
2. Set up and install Node.js while caching npm’s dependencies
3. Use npm to install the ci library
4. Use a specific version of file-changes-action to log exact changes in a JSON file named files.json after a push or pull request
5. Print the contents of files.json for the user’s review
6. Run the demo-link-checker-script.mjs file and pass it all the parameters listed
7. Run the demo-link-checker-script.mjs file and pass it different parameters
