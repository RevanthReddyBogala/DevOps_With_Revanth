# DEPLOYMENT-SCRIPT

# Automating deployment using a shell script is a common practice in software development to 
# streamline the deployment process and ensure consistency. You can use a shell script to 
# automate tasks like pulling code from a repository, building the project, and deploying it to a 
#server. 

#Here's a general outline of how you could structure such a shell script:

#!/bin/bash
# Define variables
REPO_URL="https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git"
TARGET_DIR="/path/to/deployment/directory"
BRANCH="main" # or the branch you want to deploy
BUILD_DIR="/path/to/build/directory"
# Update the code from the repository
echo "Updating code from the repository..."
cd "$TARGET_DIR" || exit
git pull origin "$BRANCH"
# Build the project (if needed)
echo "Building the project..."
cd "$BUILD_DIR" || exit
# Insert build commands here
# Deploy the project
echo "Deploying the project..."
# Insert deployment commands here
echo "Deployment complete!"
