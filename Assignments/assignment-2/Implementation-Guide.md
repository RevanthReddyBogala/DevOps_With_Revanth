# Infrastructure as Code with Terraform and Ansible

This guide will help you automate the provisioning and configuration of a cloud infrastructure using Terraform and Ansible. The infrastructure will be provisioned on AWS and will include a VPC with public and private subnets, an EC2 instance, and an S3 bucket.

## Prerequisites

AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate permissions
Terraform installed
Ansible installed

### Step 1: Setup with Terraform

Terraform Configuration

Create a directory for your Terraform files:


mkdir terraform-aws-setup
cd terraform-aws-setup
Provider Configuration

Create a main.tf file with the following content:

```main.tf
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```
VPC and Networking Components

Add the VPC, subnets, and security groups to main.tf:
```main.tf
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  enable_dns_support = true
  enable_dns_hostnames = true
  tags = {
    Name = "main-vpc"
  }
}

resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
  availability_zone = "us-east-1a"
  tags = {
    Name = "public-subnet"
  }
}

resource "aws_subnet" "private" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.2.0/24"
  availability_zone = "us-east-1a"
  tags = {
    Name = "private-subnet"
  }
}

resource "aws_internet_gateway" "main" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
  tags = {
    Name = "main-igw"
  }
}

resource "aws_route_table" "public" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
  route {
    cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
    gateway_id = aws_internet_gateway.main.id
  }
  tags = {
    Name = "public-route-table"
  }
}

resource "aws_route_table_association" "public" {
  subnet_id = aws_subnet.public.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.public.id
}

resource "aws_security_group" "web-sg" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  tags = {
    Name = "web-sg"
  }
}
```
EC2 Instance

Add the EC2 instance to main.tf:

```ec2.tf
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" # Update with the desired AMI ID
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.public.id
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.web-sg.name]

  tags = {
    Name = "web-server"
  }

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo ${aws_instance.web.public_ip} > ip_address.txt"
  }
}
```
S3 Bucket

Add the S3 bucket to main.tf:

```s3.tf
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "app_data" {
  bucket = "my-app-data-bucket-${random_id.bucket_id.hex}"
  acl    = "private"
  tags = {
    Name = "app-data-bucket"
  }
}

resource "random_id" "bucket_id" {
  byte_length = 4
}
```
Initialize and Apply Terraform Configuration

Run the following commands to initialize and apply the configuration:


terraform init
terraform apply

### Step 2: Configuration with Ansible

Ansible Inventory

Create an inventory file hosts with the IP address of your EC2 instance:

```ini
[web]
<EC2_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP>
```
Ansible Playbook

Create a playbook setup.yml to install necessary software and configure the instance:

```setup.yml
---
- hosts: web
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Update and upgrade apt packages
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
        upgrade: dist

    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Start Nginx service
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: yes

    - name: Create a simple index.html
      copy:
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html
        content: |
          <html>
          <head>
            <title>Welcome</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <h1>Hello from Ansible!</h1>
          </body>
          </html>
```
Run the Ansible Playbook

Execute the playbook to configure the EC2 instance:


`ansible-playbook -i hosts setup.yml`

### Step 3: Documentation

Setup Process

Terraform: Create and configure main.tf with provider, VPC, subnets, security groups, EC2 instance, and S3 bucket. Run terraform init and terraform apply to provision the infrastructure.
Ansible: Create an inventory file with the EC2 instance's IP address. Create a playbook to install and configure necessary software. Run ansible-playbook to configure the instance.

Execution Commands

# Terraform commands
terraform init
terraform apply

# Ansible commands
ansible-playbook -i hosts setup.yml

### Step 4: Screenshots and Logs
